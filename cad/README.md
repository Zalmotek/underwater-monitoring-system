# CAD files

This folder contains files and resources that are integral to both the conceptualization and realization stages of our product development. The specific items within this folder include:

**3D Models:** These files represent the three-dimensional renderings of our product. They are instrumental in visualizing the final physical appearance and functionality of the product.


**Mechanical Designs:** These are detailed technical drawings and specifications for the mechanical aspects of our product. They include dimensions, materials, assembly instructions, and other necessary information for manufacturing and assembling the product.


The 3D models and mechanical designs serve as both enclosures and support for our product, providing a comprehensive illustration of how the different components fit together to form the final product.
